            <td>NBA 2K continues its tradition of upping already tremendous gameplay, emulating the
                real-life sport in ways that didn’t seem possible just years ago.
                The inclusion of the WNBA may be this year’s biggest step forward, especially because it does an excellent job showcasing the many gameplay
                improvements
                from last year. MyCareer also continues to improve in small and noticeable ways, setting a new standard for story modes in sports games. 
                Still, NBA 2K20 would
                have been better off by focusing on its complex modes like MyLeague and cleaning up MyTeam to be less dependent on microtransactions.
                In spite of that, NBA 2K20 remains the best at what it does. It just might be time to ask for better.</td>

            <td>2K20’s MyCareer mode offers a better wrestling story mode than most previous WWE 2K games, that’s a low bar
                to clear – it’s still saddled with bad progression and a plodding pace. This is a mess that 2K needs to clean up in a hurry.</td>
