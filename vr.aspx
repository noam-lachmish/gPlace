            <td>Virtual Rick-ality does a great job emulating the 
                dark humor of the source material, even if it occasionally 
                overindulges in its self-awareness. Smart use of well-established VR 
                minigame mechanics guides you through the experience, and aside from some slight 
                issues navigating the space on a two-sensor Oculus Rift setup, these familiar and fun
                activities mesh well with the amusing efforts of the writing team and cast. Rick & Morty’s 
                first foray into virtual reality is not only a solid VR experience, but the duo's strongest attempt 
                at translating the spirit of the show into a game yet.
