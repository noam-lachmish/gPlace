            <td>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a resounding achievement in
                world building, environment, and engaging gameplay with occasional 
                problems throughout. Its incredible recreation of ancient Greece is something I’ll want 
                to go back to long after I’ve finished its main story, and its excellent systems mesh together
                in a way that’s hard to beat. While there are definite rough edges, Odyssey sets a new bar for Assassin’s 
                Creed games and holds its own in the eternal debate over the best open-world roleplaying games ever.

            <td>If this is in fact the last Rocksteady-developed Batman game, the series 
                will end on a high note. Arkham Knight is the biggest Batman game yet, not just 
                in map size, but in the wide range of different types of gameplay, and its collection 
                of characters. The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman
                stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us
                a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.

                it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance

                not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier
                tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.

                but after playing its 15-or-so-hour campaign it’s delightful to see just how much better Doom has
                gotten just four years later. Eternal tips its cap to Doom 2 specifically while also building off
                of what made the modernized reboot a breath of fresh air for the genre. Whether you’ve been playing Doom 
                for a few years or a few decades, Doom Eternal demands your attention.

                it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the 
                others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos,
                a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both 
                on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and 
                shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment.
                The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and

                Jurassic World: Evolution is a bad game because it’s just a bore of a park sim. Sure, 
                the dinosaurs look nice enough, but the process of unlocking new species is beyond tedious and actually
                running the business is shallow and quickly gets stale. It beats getting mauled by raptors, but after careful

                and fidelity to Disney’s beloved animated movies. While the storytelling could
                use some punching up, Square has done a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of
                these worlds while giving us a massive toolbox for battles and exploration. Even as I watched 
                the dust settle on the story I wanted to jump right back in to collect everything. But to see all of
                the events of the Kingdom Hearts games so far culminate is, frankly, weird. Having been given so much 
                time to ruminate, its specific resolutions aren’t all that surprising, but only a marginal impact is lost as 
                a result. I still loved seeing so many characters from throughout this series interact in new ways and rekindle old bonds.
                It’s nice to see that, even so long after the very first game, Kingdom Hearts 3 is so full of heart.

                I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.
