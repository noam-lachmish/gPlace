            <td>While it's not quite the absurdly violent 
                physics spectacle that Surgeon Simulator 2013 is, I Am Bread has
                its own unique charms, with a darkly silly tone, a minimal but effective story, and open-ended
                level design that's richer than the simple premise might lead you to expect. Its clumsy controls make it
                disheartening at first, but it's worth it for the reward of eventually overcoming them and finding destructive new paths 
                to toasty success.

            <td>Besides the fact that there’s absolutely no evolution involved in it,
                Jurassic World: Evolution is a bad game because it’s just a bore of a park sim. Sure, 
                the dinosaurs look nice enough, but the process of unlocking new species is beyond tedious and actually
                running the business is shallow and quickly gets stale. It beats getting mauled by raptors, but after careful
                consideration, I’ve decided not to endorse this park.

            <td>YouTubers Life OMG is an agreeable video-making tycoon game wrapped up in a few fundamental problems. The main gameplay loop is 
                compelling, and it's a pleasure to watch as your subscriber tally and bank account start to soar.
                However, some poor presentation, a clumsy camera, and a couple of other small issues stop it from being the viral hit
                it wants to be. Those looking for a casual management sim to tackle may find some enjoyment here,
                but it's hard to recommend it to anyone else.</td>
