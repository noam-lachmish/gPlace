            <td>Overall, it’s not surprising that Doom Eternal is excellent in following up Doom (2016),
                but after playing its 15-or-so-hour campaign it’s delightful to see just how much better Doom has
                gotten just four years later. Eternal tips its cap to Doom 2 specifically while also building off
                of what made the modernized reboot a breath of fresh air for the genre. Whether you’ve been playing Doom 
                for a few years or a few decades, Doom Eternal demands your attention.
