            <td>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a resounding achievement in
                world building, environment, and engaging gameplay with occasional 
                problems throughout. Its incredible recreation of ancient Greece is something I’ll want 
                to go back to long after I’ve finished its main story, and its excellent systems mesh together
                in a way that’s hard to beat. While there are definite rough edges, Odyssey sets a new bar for Assassin’s 
                Creed games and holds its own in the eternal debate over the best open-world roleplaying games ever.

            <td>If this is in fact the last Rocksteady-developed Batman game, the series 
                will end on a high note. Arkham Knight is the biggest Batman game yet, not just 
                in map size, but in the wide range of different types of gameplay, and its collection 
                of characters. The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman
                stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us
                a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.

            <td>It's difficult to ever feel completely satisfied with a play session of Skyrim. There's 
                always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, 
                one more butterfly to catch. It's a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional 
                space packed with content that consistently surprises. The changes made since Oblivion are many, and result
                in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. Featuring the same 
                kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack,
                playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely 
                personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.</td>

            <td>I expected great action from God of War,
                and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect 
                it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the 
                others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos,
                a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both 
                on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and 
                shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment.
                The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and 
                memorable game in the series.

            <td>I thoroughly enjoyed Square Enix’s evolution of Kingdom Hearts’ gameplay 
                and fidelity to Disney’s beloved animated movies. While the storytelling could
                use some punching up, Square has done a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of
                these worlds while giving us a massive toolbox for battles and exploration. Even as I watched 
                the dust settle on the story I wanted to jump right back in to collect everything. But to see all of
                the events of the Kingdom Hearts games so far culminate is, frankly, weird. Having been given so much 
                time to ruminate, its specific resolutions aren’t all that surprising, but only a marginal impact is lost as 
                a result. I still loved seeing so many characters from throughout this series interact in new ways and rekindle old bonds.
                It’s nice to see that, even so long after the very first game, Kingdom Hearts 3 is so full of heart.

            <td>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and
                a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full
                of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of 
                you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, 
                and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories.
                And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things
                I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.

            <td>Like any review, my feelings on Minecraft are the result of my experience with it.
                Maybe you don’t thrive off random adventures like I do, or maybe you won’t feel the same sense of
                accomplishment I did when I completed my first house. If not, then you likely haven’t or won’t enjoy Minecraft
                in the same way. And that’s OK. Minecraft, more than any other game I know, isn’t about playing it a specific way;
                it’s an open-world, a blank page just daring you to jump in and do with it what you will. The question, then, isn’t what
                you need to do to succeed, what’s needed to win, but what are you willing to do to make your dreams come to life?

            <td>Dragon Quest XI excels when it emphasizes fighting bad guys,
                exploring dungeons, and finding treasure. It’s a visual feast populated by a cast of 
                colorful monsters more engrossing than its main characters. Uneven story beats and some icky bits 
                sometimes slow Dragon Quest down, but superb mechanics remain the focus, making Echoes of an Elusive Age a 
                top-tier JRPG for the modern age.

            <td>I wanted Marvel’s Spider-Man on PS4 to make me feel like Spider-Man: To sail between the 
                highrises of New York City, to nimbly web up hordes of enemies, and tussle with familiar,
                animal-themed villains. Insomniac Games’ first foray into the world of Marvel handily delivers 
                on all of that. But what I didn’t expect from Spider-Man was to come away feeling just as fulfilled 
                to have inhabited the life of Peter Parker. Aside from a few odd pacing issues, which momentarily took me out
                of the experience of being a superhero, and a world of optional missions that don’t always quite live up to the heft of the main story, 
                Insomniac has delivered a 
                Spider-Man story that both surprised and delighted me, coupled with gameplay that made me
                feel like Spider-Man nearly every step of the way. </td>

            <td>Though on the surface it looks like just another "me too" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of
                Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat 
                and adventure that proves very satisfying. Fresh elements – like an absurdly expansive weapon crafting system, a broader scope of 
                monsters to battle, and a slick retro 2D presentation – make it a stand out among the pack. Hell, it took all the resolve I could muster
                just to shut the game down long enough to write this review. That's rare indeed.

                significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story
                in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, 
                that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.

                over the course of at least 70 hours of adventure through an impressively varied and rich world. Getting from
                place to place can be confusing, but outside of that and a multi-hour progression roadblock near the end this
                is an excellent game full of tough, memorable battles and a positive message.
